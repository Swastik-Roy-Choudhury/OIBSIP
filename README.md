## TASK1 : Voice Assistant
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Create a basic voice assistant that can perform simple tasks based on voice
commands. Implement features like responding to "Hello" and providing predefined responses,
telling the time or date, and searching the web for information based on user queries.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:
Speech Recognition: Learn how to recognize and process voice commands using speech
recognition libraries or APIs.
User Interaction: Create a user-friendly interaction design that allows users to communicate
with the assistant via voice commands.

## TASK2 : BMI Calculator
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their
weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories
(e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and
category to the user.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:
User Input Validation: Ensure valid user inputs within reasonable ranges and handle errors
gracefully.
BMI Calculation: Accurately implement the BMI formula.
Categorization: Classify BMI values into health categories based on predefined ranges.

## TASK 3 : Random Password Generator
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Create a command-line password generator in Python that generates random
passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers,
symbols). Allow users to specify password length and character set preferences.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:
1.Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
2.User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.
3.Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).

## TASK 4 : : Basic Weather App
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Create a command-line weather app in Python that fetches and displays current
weather data for a user-specified location (e.g., city or ZIP code) using a weather API. Show
basic information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:
1.API Integration: Connect to a weather API and parse JSON data.
2.User Input Handling: Validate and process user input for location

## TASK 5 : Chat Application
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Create a basic text-based chat application in Python where two users can
exchange messages in real-time using the command line. Implement a simple client-server
model for message exchange.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:
Networking : Learn socket programming for real-time communication
between clients and a server
